## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
   cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the application.

## 📝 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build the project for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

## 🎨 Customization

### Development Workflow

You can customize this project by editing the code directly:

- **Components**: Modify files in `src/components/` to change UI elements
- **Pages**: Update files in `src/pages/` to modify page content
- **Styles**: Tailwind classes are used throughout - no separate CSS files needed
- **Types**: Add TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/` for type safety

### Adding New Features

1. Create new components in the `src/components/` directory
2. Add new pages in the `src/pages/` directory
3. Update routing if using React Router
4. Style components using Tailwind CSS classes

## 🌐 Deployment

### Popular Deployment Options

- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel for automatic deployments
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist` folder after running `npm run build`
- **GitHub Pages**: Use GitHub Actions to deploy from your repository
- **AWS S3**: Upload the build files to an S3 bucket for static hosting

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with optimized files ready for deployment.

## 🌍 Custom Domain

Most hosting providers offer custom domain configuration:

1. Purchase a domain from a registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Update your DNS settings to point to your hosting provider
3. Configure SSL certificates for HTTPS
4. Update any environment variables with your new domain

## 🛠️ Development Tips

### Code Quality

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Performance

- Lazy load components when possible
- Optimize images and assets
- Use React.memo for expensive components
